# 14.2.1 Frontend - Initialize Git Repository

● Click on the Design icon of your application. It will navigate to the App designer of 	your application

● In the left panel area, click on the Git icon. Notice that you are already connected to Git. 	You may click on Settings to verify.

● Click on the button Initialize





● In the popup, input the following and click on Initialize to create the gitlab repository: 	○ Repository name: fe-product



● Verify the following initialized frontend repositories in your gitlab project.

● Currently, these initialized repositories are empty. In the later tutorial we will show you 	how you can generate and push your code into these defined repositories.

14.2.2 Backend - Initialize Git Repository 
Backend - Create Service (Prerequisite)





You may initialize your BE repository through the Service Designer after the creation of your microservice(s).

Let us first create an empty Product Service first so that the BE repository can be initialized. Note that a microservice for your application needs to be created first before you can initialize your BE Git repository. Not to worry as we will cover more details on the Service Designer tutorial below.

● Click Services to launch the user interface.

● Select Add Service in the Service API Designer.

● In the configuration panel, name your microservice to represent its function (e.g., 	"Product” for Product microservice). Click Apply.















● In the Service Designer, the Product Service has a couple of features which we will 	explore further in later tutorials.

● In your Service Designer, click on the Git icon (Manage Branch) on your Service.

● Click Initialize toset upyour BE repository.









● You should be able to see this newly created repository reflected on Git as well.

● KAIZEN will create these 3 repositories under the defined group.

Note: 
If you connect to git again with the repositories already present and initialized, clicking on the initialized button will not create new repositories. The success message will flag out accordingly that this repository with this name has already been initialized when connecting.
