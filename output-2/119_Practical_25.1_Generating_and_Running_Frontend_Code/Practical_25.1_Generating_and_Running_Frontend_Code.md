# Practical 25.1: Generating and Running Frontend Code

Generating frontend code in KAIZEN streamlines the creation of interactive user interfaces by transforming user-defined JSON Schemas into functional React code. This automated process accelerates development, ensures consistency, and minimizes errors, allowing developers to focus on business logic and user experience rather than repetitive coding tasks. By using visual design tools and pre-defined templates, teams can quickly prototype, iterate, and deploy applications, making KAIZEN an effective solution for efficient software delivery.
