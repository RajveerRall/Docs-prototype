# 6.1.1 Setup Steps

● From the Component Library, drag a Cell Component to the top of the Table in the 	Course Table Page that you have created from Tutorial 5.







● Drag a Tab Component into the Cell Component.

● Rename the tabs (and remove any extra) so that there are only these 2 tabs: ‘Price 	Comparison’ and ‘Enrollment’.

Once you are done, you should have something like this:







6.1.2 Adding a Bar Graph 
	● Select the ‘Price Comparison’ tab in the Tab Component.

● From the Component Library, search for ‘chart’ and drag a Bar Chart Component (aka 	Column Component) into the Price Comparison Tab.

6.1.3 Sending Data to the Graph 
	● Select the Column Component and under the Props Tab, click on Variable Binding.

● Under ‘Variable List’, Select ‘State attribute’, then select ‘data’.





● Click the ‘Confirm’ button.

Note the graph has disappeared.

● Change the ‘x-axis label’ to price and the ‘y-axis label’ to name.

● With the Bar Chart Component still selected, go to the Styles tab and change the Height 	to 600px.





If you click on Preview, you can hover over each column to see their specific x-axis labels.
