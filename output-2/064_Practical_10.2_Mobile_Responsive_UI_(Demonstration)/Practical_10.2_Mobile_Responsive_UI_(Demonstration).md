# Practical 10.2: Mobile Responsive UI (Demonstration)

This practical covers the following Learning Objectives:

● Learn to configure table rows to collapse for optimal display on smaller screen sizes. ● Explore adaptive design techniques to ensure usability across various device types.

In this practical, you will learn how to apply the collapse row feature to optimize table data presentation for small screens, which is one of the mobile responsive features provided.

● Navigate to the Course Table page and click on the ‘mobile’ view icon.

● When you scroll down to the table, notice that its view is not user friendly when in mobile 	screen size as you need to navigate via horizontal scrolling.

● Click on the table. In props, select ‘Collapse Row’ for responsive table type.





Notice that your table will now be collapsed on mobile view, which is a more intuitive and user friendly interface.
