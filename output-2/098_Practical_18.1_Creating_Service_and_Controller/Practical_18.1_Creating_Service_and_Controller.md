# Practical 18.1: Creating Service and Controller

The Service API Designer in development enables users to visually create and manage APIs with minimal coding effort. It simplifies the process of defining API endpoints, adding controllers, configuring datasource, and handling data types through an intuitive drag-and-drop interface. With built-in import/export features and code generation capabilities, the tool allows developers to efficiently design and integrate APIs into their applications. This feature streamlines API management, making it accessible to both technical and non-technical users, while ensuring that services are well-organized and maintainable.
