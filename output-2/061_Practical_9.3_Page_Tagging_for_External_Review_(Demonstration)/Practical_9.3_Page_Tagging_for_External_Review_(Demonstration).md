# Practical 9.3: Page Tagging for External Review (Demonstration)

This practical covers the following Learning Objectives:

● Learn how to implement page tagging for external review, enabling stakeholders to view 	specific versions of your application.

● Understand how to manage and control which updates are visible to external reviewers 	while hiding upcoming revisions.

● Explore how to tag pages for review, ensuring customers can only view the current 	version and not unfinished updates.

In this practical, you will learn how to use page tagging for external review, which allows you to mark specific versions of your application for stakeholder review. By tagging pages, you ensure that external reviewers can only see the current version of the application, while any ongoing revisions remain hidden. This feature helps to maintain a clear and organized review process, ensuring that external feedback is based on a consistent, unaltered version of the product.

● We will be using the Designer Training application in our TrainingFoundation project. ● Under the revision history of each page, you can click on the button for external viewers 	to preview that particular published version. Subsequent versions with further 
	enhancements by the project team will not be visible to external viewers when they 	preview the application.







● We have assigned a customer user account with an external viewer role assigned for 	this application as seen to demonstrate this.

● Now as a customer, the customer will only be able to see this version tagged for them to 	review and not subsequent versions when previewing this application.
