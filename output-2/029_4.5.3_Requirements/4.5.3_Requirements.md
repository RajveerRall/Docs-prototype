4.5.6 Form Completion 
Your finished Form 4 should look like this:







Practical 4.6: Cascade Dropdown 
4.6.1 Context 
Recall the 1st form, Course Info. There were 2 Select dropdown fields in that form: 	● Enrollment Type - which is values like Part-time, Full-time and Online/Remote.

● Subject Type - The subject of the course (eg. Business, Computing etc.) 
Now, let’s say there was a change in requirements: the Part-time, Full-time and Online/Remote courses can only have certain subject types. What we will need to do is to implement some conditional logic to handle that.

4.6.2 Requirements 
In the 1st Form, Course Info, 
	● The Select dropdown from Enrollment Type should populate a different set of values of 		Subject Type:

4.6.3 Adding the Logic 
	● Open the Source Code Panel and uncomment lines 14 - 25.







● Uncomment the section under /** 4.6.3 **/  (lines 76 - 81). Then click the Save button.

● Click on the Select Component of the Enrollment Type Form Item. In the Events tab, click on the Component native event button and then click onChange from the dropdown.







● Under Select event, click on Event, then click on onChange_EnrollmentType. Once 	done, click on the Confirm button.

● Click on the Select Component of the Subject Type Form Item. Click on the Switch 	Setter on the top right of the Datasource panel.







● Select the Variable Input from the dropdown.

● Click on the “Please input expression” box and select this.state.subjectTypeArray
