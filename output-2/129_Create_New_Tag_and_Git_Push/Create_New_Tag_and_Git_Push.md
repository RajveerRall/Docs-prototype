# Create New Tag and Git Push

● Earlier you have configured your respective service and controller in the Service Designer. Now we will proceed to generate the BE code and push these changes onto this new branch.









● This will successfully push both the FE and BE code onto the specified branch on Git. ● Similar to FE code push, notice that we can also create a tag for the BE code that we 	want to push to allow us to manage releases for features built.

Merge Code to Main Branch + Push Main Branch 
	● Once you are done making relevant enhancements on your current enhancement 		branch, we will now proceed to merge your BE changes to the main branch as well. 		Switch back to the main branch.

● Click on this merge button to merge into the main branch.





● Select the new branch you pushed your code to earlier to merge into the main branch.



● Before you merge, notice that the new additions will be highlighted in green. You will need to specify what you want to merge in by clicking on the blue arrows at each





individual addition or on top to merge in all new additions. After which, click on the ‘merge’ button.

● Notice that your main branch on KAIZEN’s Service Designer now has the newly merged 	new datasource from the enhancement branch.

● Next, we will proceed to push these changes on the main branch onto Git. As done in the earlier step, click on the commit icon of the branch you are on and proceed to commit changes, which will generate the BE code and push into Git.











● You may verify these code changes pushed onto the main branch on Git as well.
