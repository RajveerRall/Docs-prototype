# Managing Pages

A **Page** is the canvas for your user interface. It is the top-level container for all the content that a user will see on a single screen. Before you can add components like forms, tables, or charts, you must first create a page to hold them.

## Creating a New Page

All pages are created and managed from the **[Resource Panel](../app-designer-ui/resource-panel.md)**. When you create a new page, you are essentially creating a blank slate on which you can build a specific part of your application's UI.

## Building the Page Layout

Once you have a page, the next step is to define its structure. A well-structured layout is essential for creating a user experience that is both intuitive and responsive.

The process of building a page layout involves two key concepts:

1.  **[Layout Hierarchy](./hierarchy.md):** Understanding the relationship between Sections, Blocks, and Cells is the first step in building a solid foundation for your page. This hierarchy allows you to create everything from simple, single-column layouts to complex, multi-column designs.

2.  **[Building a Screen Skeleton](./building-a-screen-skeleton.md):** Before adding content, it is best practice to build a "screen skeleton." This involves using the layout components to create the high-level structure of your page, ensuring that it is well-organized and ready for your components.

By first creating your pages and then building a thoughtful layout skeleton, you can ensure that your application is scalable, maintainable, and provides a consistent user experience across all screens.
