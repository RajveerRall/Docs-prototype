# Canvas

The **Canvas** is the central workspace of the KAIZEN App Designer where you design and arrange the elements of your project. It's the interactive area where you create, build, and visualize your application interface.

## Canvas Overview

The Canvas provides a live, real-time preview of your application, allowing you to see your changes as you make them. It's designed to give you an intuitive understanding of how your application will look and function for end-users.

### Key Characteristics

- **Live Preview:** See changes in real-time as you design
- **Interactive Workspace:** Select, move, and resize components directly
- **Visual Design:** WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) interface
- **Responsive Design:** Visualize how your layout adapts to different screen sizes

## Canvas Functionality

### Component Selection

- **Click to Select:** Click on any component to select it for editing
- **Multi-selection:** Hold Ctrl/Cmd to select multiple components
- **Selection Indicators:** Clear visual feedback shows which components are selected
- **Selection in Tree:** Components can also be selected from the Component Tree

### Component Manipulation

- **Drag and Drop:** Move components around the Canvas to reposition them
- **Resize Components:** Use handles to adjust component dimensions
- **Copy and Paste:** Duplicate components for reuse
- **Delete Components:** Remove unwanted components from your design

### Layout Management

- **Grid System:** Use the built-in grid system for consistent layouts
- **Alignment Tools:** Align components horizontally and vertically
- **Spacing Controls:** Manage spacing between components
- **Responsive Breakpoints:** Configure how layouts adapt to different screen sizes

## Canvas Workflow

### Design Process

1. **Plan Your Layout:** Consider the structure and organization of your page
2. **Add Components:** Drag components from the Component Library to the Canvas
3. **Arrange Elements:** Position and size components according to your design
4. **Configure Properties:** Use the Setter Plugin to customize component behavior
5. **Test and Refine:** Preview your design and make adjustments as needed

### Best Practices

- **Start with Structure:** Begin by adding layout components (Sections, Blocks, Cells)
- **Use Grid System:** Leverage the grid system for consistent spacing and alignment
- **Test Responsiveness:** Regularly check how your design looks on different screen sizes
- **Iterate Quickly:** Make small changes and preview frequently to refine your design

## Canvas Integration

### With Other Panels

- **Resource Panel:** Pages and assets are displayed and managed here
- **Plugin Panel:** Components and tools are accessed from here
- **Setter Plugin:** Component properties are configured here when components are selected

### With Preview Mode

- **Live Preview:** Canvas changes are immediately reflected in preview mode
- **Functionality Testing:** Test interactive elements directly on the Canvas
- **User Experience Validation:** Ensure the design meets user experience requirements
