# Resource Panel

The Resource Panel, located on the left side of the App Designer, is your project’s control center. It helps you create, organize, and maintain all the pages and assets your application needs.

## Pages

A **Page** is a separate screen or view in your application, like a login screen, a dashboard, or a product listing. The "Pages" section of the Resource Panel is where you manage the overall structure of your application.

### Creating a New Page

To add a new page to your application, simply click the **"+"** icon next to the "Pages" heading. You will be prompted to enter the page details, such as its name and Page ID.

## Assets

The **Assets** section is your project’s media and file library. This is where you upload and manage all the static files your application will use.

### Uploading Assets

To upload a new asset, click the **"+"** icon next to the "Assets" heading. You can upload a wide variety of file types, including:

-   **Images** (JPG, PNG, SVG) for backgrounds, icons, and illustrations.
-   **CSS files** for custom styles that can be applied across your application.
-   **JavaScript files** for custom client-side logic and interactivity.
-   **Font files** to bring your own typography into the project.
