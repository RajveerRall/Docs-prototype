# Core Concepts

To get the most out of KAIZEN, it's helpful to understand the key concepts and components that make up the platform.

## The KAIZEN Ecosystem

The KAIZEN platform is not a single tool, but a suite of integrated designers and services that work together. This is often referred to as the **KAIZEN Studio**.

### Key Components

*   **App Designer:** The visual, drag-and-drop environment for building user interfaces (the "frontend"). This is where you design pages, add components like forms and tables, and manage the user experience.

*   **Service Designer:** The tool for creating and managing the "backend" logic of your application. You can define APIs, connect to external services, and manage how data is handled.

*   **Database Designer:** A visual interface for creating and managing your application's database schema. You can define tables, columns, and relationships without writing complex SQL.

*   **Workflow Designer:** A powerful tool for automating business processes. You can visually map out multi-step workflows, define logic, and assign tasks to different users or systems.

*   **Theme Designer:** Allows you to customize the look and feel of your applications. You can manage color schemes, fonts, and layouts to ensure consistent branding.

*   **Identity & Access Management (IAM):** A centralized service for managing users, roles, and permissions. IAM ensures that your applications are secure and that users only have access to the features and data they are authorized to see.

### Fundamental Terminology

*   **Application:** A project in KAIZEN. An application can be a standalone app, or it can be a "Main" application that coordinates multiple "Micro" applications.
*   **Page:** A single screen or view within an application. You build pages in the App Designer.
*   **Component:** The building blocks of a page. Components can be simple (like a Button or Text) or complex (like a Table or a Chart).
*   **Service:** A backend microservice that provides data and functionality to your application via APIs.
*   **Datasource:** A connection to a data source, such as a database or an external API, which you can then bind to your frontend components.
