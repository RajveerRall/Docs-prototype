# Tutorial 0: Foundational Concepts

This tutorial covers the following Learning Objectives:

- Understand the basic fundamentals, building blocks, concepts of saving, previewing, and publishing in KAIZEN.

Foundational concepts are the building blocks for working with KAIZEN. In this tutorial, we will explore the platform's core functionalities, such as saving progress, previewing work in progress, and publishing changes to ensure a smooth and efficient development process.

## Studio Console

Note that not all the Sidebar Menu Items and Project Features will be accessible in your trainee account due to Identity and Access Management (IAM) access restrictions. In order to access the features, the respective roles need to be granted to your user account.

In a project scenario, our application offers predefined roles that can be assigned to users, such as Project Manager, Developer, UI Designer, Internal Viewer, and External Viewer. Each role is tailored with specific access levels, enabling precise control over features and functionalities for managing both applications and the overall project.

For more information on the IAM features, you may refer to Tutorial 28.

## App Designer

### Resource Panel
The Resource Panel is where you manage and access various pages related to your application.

### Plugin Panel
The Plugin Panel is a section that displays and allows you to manage the plugins or extensions integrated into the platform or software. Plugins enhance functionality or provide additional features.

### Component Tree
The Component Tree is a hierarchical view that represents the structure of the components within your project. It visually organizes and displays the relationships between different elements.

### Components Library
The Components Library is a collection of pre-built components that you can easily drag and drop into your application.

### Datasource
Datasource refers to the data connection or repository from which your application retrieves information such as API.

### Source Code Panel
The Source Code Panel is where you can view and edit the underlying source code of your project. It provides direct access to the code for users who prefer or need to work at the code level.

### Revision
The Revision feature allows you to track changes made to your project over time. It provides a version history, making it easy to revert to a previous state if needed.

### Comments
Comments are annotations or notes that you can add to your application. They provide explanations, insights, or instructions for yourself or collaborators.

### Page Scan
Page Scan is a tool that analyzes and checks your project or application for potential issues, errors, or improvements. It helps ensure the quality and performance of your work.

### Libraries
Libraries are collections of reusable code or resources that can be imported into your project. They save time and effort by providing pre-built functionalities.

### Schema
Schema defines the structure and organization of your data in JSON format. It outlines the relationships, constraints, and rules governing how data is stored and accessed.

### Responsive Layout
Responsive Layout refers to the design approach that ensures your project adapts and looks good on various devices and screen sizes, providing a consistent user experience.

### Save Draft, Publish, Reset, Preview
- **Save**: Allows you to save your project progress
- **Reset**: Reverts changes
- **Preview**: Enables you to see how your project will appear or function before finalizing

### Page Lock
Mechanism designed to control and manage collaborative editing in a shared project environment. This ensures that critical or in-progress work on a page is not unintentionally modified or overwritten by others, providing a conflict-free editing process.

### Canvas
The Canvas is the visual workspace where you design and arrange the elements of your project. It's the area where you create and build.

### Component Operation
Component Operation involves managing and manipulating individual elements or components within your project, such as copying, locking, or deleting them.

### Setter Plugin
A Setter Plugin is a tool or extension that allows you to configure or set specific properties or attributes of components within your project.

## Key Concepts Summary

Understanding these foundational concepts is crucial for effective development in KAIZEN:

1. **Workspace Management**: Learn to navigate between different panels and understand their purposes
2. **Component System**: Master the drag-and-drop component system and component tree structure
3. **Data Management**: Understand how datasources and schemas work together
4. **Version Control**: Use revision history and page locking for collaborative development
5. **Quality Assurance**: Utilize page scan and preview features before publishing

These concepts form the foundation for all advanced tutorials and real-world development scenarios.
