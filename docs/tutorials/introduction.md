### App Designer

The App Designer feature empowers users to create user-friendly pages effortlessly within a visual workspace. With a drag-and-drop interface, you can design and arrange components intuitively, bringing your project to life without writing complex code. Whether you're building interactive interfaces or structuring layouts, the App Designer streamlines the entire process, making development faster and more efficient.

### Theme Designer

The Theme Designer allows for the customization of the application's visual appearance, ensuring a consistent and appealing user experience. It enables designers to apply brand-specific styles across the application, adjusting colors, fonts, and layouts. This feature enhances accessibility and visual appeal for users across different regions.
