We will also learn how to initialize new repositories directly from KAIZEN. This integration enhances the CI/CD pipeline by automating the process of committing and pushing changes, thus improving efficiency and collaboration. Additionally, we will also learn how to create a new branch in order to work on feature enhancements or bug fixes in a project setting.
