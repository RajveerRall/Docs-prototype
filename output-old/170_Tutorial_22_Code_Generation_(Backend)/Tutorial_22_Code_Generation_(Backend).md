# Tutorial 22: Code Generation (Backend)

Generating backend code in KAIZEN simplifies the creation of robust server-side applications by converting user-defined configurations into structured Java code, including Value Objects (VOs) and application properties. This automated process enhances productivity by eliminating the need for manual coding, reducing the risk of errors, and ensuring adherence to best practices. Developers can easily integrate business logic, manage data access through DAOs, and configure application settings, all while maintaining a consistent architecture. By leveraging code generation tools, teams can accelerate backend development, streamline workflows, and focus on delivering high-quality applications efficiently.
