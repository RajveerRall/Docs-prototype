# Context

Before we go to the next Practical, let’s say now that we want to enhance this form a little bit. Maybe the Form can also, in practice, take in the personal particulars of this instructor with MyInfo. Of course, we are not going to actually connect to MyInfo to get actual data - that’s the job of the backend developers.

But we can still populate the form in the Kaizen App Designer, sort of like a proof-of-concept for the actual form. We can do this by using a function of the Next.Field library, called setValue().
