# Context

Recall the 1st form, Course Info. There were 2 Select dropdown fields in that form:



Enrollment Type - which is values like Part-time, Full-time and Online/Remote.

Subject Type - The subject of the course (eg. Business, Computing etc.)



Now, letâ€™s say there was a change in requirements: the Part-time, Full-time and Online/Remote courses can only have certain subject types. What we will need to do is to implement some conditional logic to handle that.
