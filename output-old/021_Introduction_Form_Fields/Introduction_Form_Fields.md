# Introduction: Form Fields

Forms are components that accept inputs from various Form fields and then, through user interaction (usually a button press), submit the field information from the form to the backend for processing.

Previously, we encountered forms in Tutorial 1. A refresher on what the form looked like:





As you can see, the form contains an Email Field, a Password Field and a Login Button.



The Email Field is known as an Input Field, which accepts open-ended values of text you type from the keyboard. The Password field is a special Input Field that does what the Email field does, but also masks the input so that others cannot see what is being typed on screen.

Finally, the Login button submits the values that the user keyed in for each field, possibly to an Authentication Server.

While this is sufficient for a Login Form, modern web languages also support a multitude of other form fields, like radio buttons, dropdown selects, date pickers and more. Fortunately, Kaizen supports a good number of these.

In order to access them in the Kaizen App Designer, you can go to the Component Library and search for them.

We will get to use them when we get to the practicals later on.
