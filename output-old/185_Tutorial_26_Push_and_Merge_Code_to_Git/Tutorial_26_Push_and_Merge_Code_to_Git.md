# Tutorial 26: Push and Merge Code to Git

This tutorial covers the following Learning Objectives:



Managing branches and tags within KAIZEN.

Learn to push changes to a Gitlab repository from KAIZEN for both frontend and backend code.

In earlier tutorials, we have learnt how to set up the connection to Git and switch to a new branch to work on various enhancements and test your application to run locally. Now, we’ll learn how to automate the process of committing and pushing changes in KAIZEN, thus improving efficiency and collaboration. We will demonstrate how the integration with GitLab’s CI/CD pipeline feature automates the testing and deployment, streamlining the release process directly from KAIZEN.
