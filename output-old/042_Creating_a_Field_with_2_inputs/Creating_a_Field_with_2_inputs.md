# Creating a Field with 2 inputs



Sometimes you will need to create a form field with 2 fields. The example we used in this scenario is a floor/unit no (eg #02-16) field.



Here is the revised table with the Floor and Unit No. separate.





It is possible to handle this in the Designer by using the 2 Columns or 3 Columns Component.



Remove the Input component within the Floor / Unit No. Form Item.





Drag a 3 Columns Component to the Floor / Unit No Form Item.





Drag a Form Item Component each for the left and right columns. Drag a Text Component into the Center column.





Drag Input Components into the left and right Form Items.





Ctrl + Click to select both Form Item Components.

Change their Styles to Large.
