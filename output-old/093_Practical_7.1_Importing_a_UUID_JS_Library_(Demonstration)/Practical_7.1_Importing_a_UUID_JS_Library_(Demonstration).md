# Practical 7.1: Importing a UUID JS Library (Demonstration)



We will be returning to the Step Form page we created before to demonstrate how to use this feature.

Letâ€™s say, now, the Instructor has to submit a special Registration code that was provided to them before to confirm their identity. This Registration code will be in a UUIDv4 format. When working on the form, we would like to generate the UUID to make it more convenient for ourselves.

However, by default, the Kaizen App Designer does not have a library to generate UUIDs. Fortunately, Kaizen is capable of supporting external JS libraries to help with this.
