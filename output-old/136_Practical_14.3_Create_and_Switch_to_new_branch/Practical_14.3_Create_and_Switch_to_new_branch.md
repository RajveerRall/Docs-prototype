# Practical 14.3: Create and Switch to new branch



In KAIZEN, frontend Git branch management is essential for maintaining an organized and efficient workflow. By creating separate branches for UI changes, such as theme updates, new features or bug fixes, developers can isolate modifications, avoid conflicts, and ensure smooth collaboration across teams. This approach supports parallel development, minimizes disruption to the main codebase, and allows for better testing and integration of frontend updates, ultimately enhancing project quality and stability.
