# Practical 26.2: Backend Git Management (Optional)



In KAIZEN, using Git branches for backend enhancements, such as adding a new API, is critical for maintaining clean, structured development workflows. By creating a separate branch for each enhancement, developers can work independently on new features without affecting the stability of the main application. This approach allows for safe testing, minimizes conflicts, and enables smoother collaboration among team members. Once the changes are tested and validated, the new API enhancements can be easily merged back into the main codebase, ensuring a stable and organized development process.
