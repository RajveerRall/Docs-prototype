# Steps for Creating a Modal Dialog

Drag a Dialog Component to the Designer. Anywhere in the workspace will do.





Change the Title to ‘Form Submission’ and add a Text Component to the Cell in the

middle of the Modal Dialog box. Change the Text to ‘Confirm your Submission?’.





Click on the Dialog Component and under the Props Tab, change the blue button’s Label (Help) to ‘Confirm’ under the Dialog Component’s Prop tab.
