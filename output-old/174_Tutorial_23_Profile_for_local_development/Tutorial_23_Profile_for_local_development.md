# Tutorial 23: Profile for local development

This tutorial covers the following Learning Objectives:



Learn how to configure profiles for local development within your application.

Understand how to redirect traffic to different resources based on the environment.

Improve local development workflows by integrating API calls with KAIZEN seamlessly.



In this tutorial, you will learn about configuring profiles that allow you to redirect traffic to different resources, enhancing local development. This feature enables smooth development of APIs in a local environment while still interacting with KAIZEN resources, improving the overall development experience.

Essentially, you can use profile to configure and connect to different environments, allowing you to easily access the APIs there from your frontend pages in the app designer. All these can be done without having to build and run your entire frontend application locally. Note that you can only connect to 1 profile at a time.
