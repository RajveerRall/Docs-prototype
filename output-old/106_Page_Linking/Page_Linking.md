# Page Linking

Once all your pages and Navigator Menus are created, we can connect them to ensure a seamless experience by binding the onClick event.

In your Login Page, bind the onClick event.





Add the following code in the JS Source Code Panel.

The navigateTo function takes in two parameters, the “App ID” and “Page ID”. Replace

with your application IDs accordingly.





Save your changes and try to login in preview mode! Your page should navigate over to the landing page successfully.
