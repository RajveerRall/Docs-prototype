## Introduction

Welcome to the KAIZEN Training Program! We are thrilled to have you embark on this learning journey with us. This comprehensive guide is designed to provide you with the information and resources you need to make the most out of your training experience.

About KAIZEN



KAIZEN is a cutting-edge agile development stack designed for individuals and teams who want to accelerate application development without compromising on flexibility and customization.

Our platform is built to simplify the entire software development lifecycle, from ideation to deployment, and subsequently to maintenance.





Key Features



In this training, we will be walking you through the following features:



App Designer



The App Designer feature empowers users to create user-friendly pages effortlessly within a visual workspace. With a drag-and-drop interface, you can design and arrange components intuitively, bringing your project to life without writing complex code. Whether you're building interactive interfaces or structuring layouts, the App Designer streamlines the entire process, making development faster and more efficient.



Theme Designer



The Theme Designer allows for the customization of the application's visual appearance, ensuring a consistent and appealing user experience. It enables designers to apply brand- specific styles across the application, adjusting colors, fonts, and layouts. This feature enhances accessibility and visual appeal for users across different regions

Main and Micro Application



This feature encompasses the architecture where a central main application coordinates with multiple micro applications. The main app serves as the core, integrating various micro apps that handle specific functionalities, promoting modularity and scalability.

Git Setup and Branch Management



Git Setup and Branch Management ensures smooth collaboration by enabling version control, branching, and code integration. Developers can work on separate features without conflict, while maintaining a clear and organized codebase. This tool supports efficient team workflows and ensures up-to-date code management.

Workflow Designer



The Workflow feature allows for the automation of business processes through predefined steps. Users can design and execute workflows that involve multiple stages and actors, ensuring tasks are completed in a systematic and efficient manner.

Master Code



The Master Code feature provides a centralized system for managing reference data used across the application. It supports multilingual capabilities, allowing for localization and consistent data management.

Database Designer



The Database Designer simplifies database schema creation and management, allowing developers to define tables and relationships with ease. It ensures efficient data organization, accessibility, and scalability for the application. This feature improves performance and helps optimize data storage for future development.

Service Designer



The Service Designer streamlines the creation and management of APIs, connecting application components and external services. It provides an intuitive interface to define endpoints and parameters, making API development faster and more efficient. This feature enhances backend and frontend communication, supporting complex application workflows.



Job Scheduler



The Job Scheduler enables the scheduling and execution of tasks at specified times or intervals. It supports various scheduling strategies, ensuring that tasks are performed efficiently and on time, with detailed configuration options for each job.

Code Generation



The Code Generation feature automates the creation of boilerplate code, reducing development time and errors. It helps in generating consistent and standardized code structures for various components, ensuring best practices and efficiency in the development process.
